

Aggregate functions without "A"
			Support numeric columns only
		Ex: count, sum, average, max, min etc.

Aggregate Functions with "A"
		Work on Textual values, Boolean or Logical values (True, False), and blank values.
		While working True considered as "1", false / blank / text value considered as "0"
		Ex: countA, averageA, maxA, minA etc.

Practice:
		Create a table like below
		Eid Salary Validtity  Jdate
		1    10000   True        2022-02-01		

		2    20000	  False      2022-09-01
		3                 True       2022-08-01
		

	Note: COunt and Average fails when we take on Validaity column, whereas COuntA, AverageA, MaxA, and MinA work 		on validity column.
